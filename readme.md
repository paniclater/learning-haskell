## Haskell Exercises

I'm finially feeling like I can start writing some Haskell to solve simple problems and do code exercises.
When I was learning Java I found it very helpful to write small programs around every concept I was learning in order to prepare for the Oracle Certification Exams.
I don't have any formal way of recording that, so I plan on writing exercises around [Learn You A Haskell For A Great Good](https://learnyouahaskell.com) and [Haskell Programming From First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) as well as doing at least 5 katas from [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) every day. We'll see how it goes, and hopefully I will be writing web applications with [yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com) any day now!
